### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Clay, and you've found my GitHub profile. I am currently an undergradute student of physics who likes to code with Python; especially interesting to me is data visualization and visually appealing simulations and animations created in matplotlib, but I'm always learning other useful modules as well. You'll find some of my favorite projects in the repositories on my account.
